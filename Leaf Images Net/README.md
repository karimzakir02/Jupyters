# Leaf Images Neural Net [WIP]

This is a mini data science project aimed at creating a neural net in order to classify a healthy and a diseased leaf using different machine learning tools. The project will be completed in several stages:

1. Data Exploration [WIP]
2. Data Augmentation [WIP]
3. Data Modeling [WIP]
