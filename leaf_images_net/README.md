# Leaf Images Neural Net [WIP]

This is a mini data science project aimed at creating a neural net in order to classify a healthy and a diseased leaf using different machine learning tools. The data for this project was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/collection-of-different-category-of-leaf-images); it wasn't included in the GitHub due to its size. The project will be completed in several stages:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Modeling [WIP]

Let me know if you have any feedback on this investigation by opening an issue! Would love to hear your thoughts!
