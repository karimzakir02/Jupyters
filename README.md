# Jupyters
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with data analysis or machine learning I explore in my free time. Here's a quick breakdown about each subproject:
- leaf_images_net: a neural network focused on classifying whether the leaves are diseased or not
- lung_cancer_classification: a data science workflow focusing on creating a model to classify whether a patient has lung cancer or not based on numerical data from an imbalanced dataset
- optiver_comp: displays my submission for the [Optiver Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction).
- outliers: a notebook focusing on different ways to detect and remove outliers from a dataset
- playground: a notebook for me to quickly demo interesting concepts and methods. 

Let me know if you have any feedback on my notebooks or analysis by opening an issue on GitHub. I would love to hear it!
